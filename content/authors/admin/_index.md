    summary: |
      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I'm Huynh Tan Khang and currently a CS student at UIT in Ho Chi Minh. In my leisure time, you'll often find me listening to music and researching. This dual interest not only provides relaxation but also fuels my curiosity especially in Al term because my life motto is never to be satisfied with oneself about the world around me. In terms of my future vision, I aspire to become an Al Researcher/engineer
